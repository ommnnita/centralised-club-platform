# College Club & Event Management Platform

A centralized backend-first web platform designed to manage college clubs, events, internal sessions, and student attendance using QR-based verification.

## Problem
College clubs currently rely on multiple WhatsApp groups for announcements, events, and attendance, leading to poor tracking and lack of accountability.

## Solution
This platform provides:
- Centralized club and event management
- Role-based access (Super Admin, Club Admin, Student)
- Public events and internal club sessions
- Mandatory attendance via QR codes
- Verifiable participation records

## Tech Stack
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Auth: JWT
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, minimal JS

## Status
🚧 Under active development for DevJam (Weekend of Code 2026).
